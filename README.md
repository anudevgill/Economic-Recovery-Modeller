# Economic-Recovery-Modeller
A machine learning model that uses retail trade sales and Real-Time Local Business Condition Index (RTLBCI) data from Statistics Canada to predict economic recovery after COVID-19.
The program works by training Scikit-Learn's linear regression models on data from the past decade and uses this to graph future trends in retail trade sales and RTLBCI values for a variety of industries.
